this is an unofficial cvs2git import from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios-snmp/develop

the support tracker is still located at sf.net
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=134917

if you're missing utils.pm, either install the nagios-plugins package,
or copy plugins/utils.pm to your perl lib path, or the one included like
use lib "/usr/local/icinga/libexec";
